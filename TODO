### Goals:

  - Have a Passenger Standalone production image for Ruby, Node.JS and Python projects
  - The production image must have a minimal footprint
  - Have a build environment image for these images so their native dependencies can easily be built
  - Support multiple versions of each platform to support most users
  - Have tests of the image for some large projects (i.e. discourse, etc)
  - Have documentation on common operations

### Steps:

  - implement building of ruby build and production containers for 2.3 and 1.9
  - test and fix containers for some projects (discourse, rails-5-actioncable?)
  - implement building of node.js build and production containers
  - test and fix containers for node.js
